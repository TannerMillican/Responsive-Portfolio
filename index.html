      <p>Hi! My name is Tanner Millican. I'm 24, married, and have three cats. I've had quite a few jobs, but my most
        recent one was as a POS field technician. I've always had a great fondness for computers and technology in
        general. I love all forms of art, especially creating it. Drawing and painting are my absolute favorite
        forms of making art. In fact, as a small child, my dream was to become a famous artist on the level of
        Michelangelo, Van Gogh, and the like.
      </p>

      <p>One of my favorite activities is playing an online MMORPG called Runescape. I've played it since I was at least
        12. I often find myself getting lost in it for hours on end before realizing just how much time has passed. I
        also think it served as a great gateway into my most recent obsession.
      </p>

      <p>That obsession would be Dungeons and Dragons. I absolutely love the concept of a table top RPG. And being set
        in fantasy medieval times, Dungeons and Dragons really struck a cord with me. Sadly, my group has dissolved and
        I've had trouble finding another group to play in (seeing as how I live in such a small town).
